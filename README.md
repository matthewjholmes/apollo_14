# Apollo 14

This Rails application is intended to be used as an opportunity for students to measure their own learning from week 2 of module 2 of the back-end program of the Turing School of Software & Design.

Fork this repository and clone your newly created repository. 

## Be sure to read all user stories BEFORE beginning your work

## Setup

- Fork this repository
- Clone down **your** forked repository
- Perform the usual setup steps after cloning a Rails application:
     - `bundle install`, 
     - `rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}`
     
## Requirements

- TDD all new work; you may postpone model tests for attribute validations ONLY; any model METHODS you write must be fully tested.

## Not Required

- No form input is required or expected
- No visual styling is required or expected

## Before Starting User Stories

- This challenge uses a many-to-many table (your migrations are already built!), be sure to check your setup carefully.
- You will have 4 failing model tests. (Let your instructor know if you are not seeing 4 failing tests)
- Get these 4 tests to pass **before** moving on to the user stories.
